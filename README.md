# Flashers
A FlashCard building/sharing social app, Built using graphQL, Apollo Client, and React. I have been practicing my graphQL approach. 
This still need a lot work, but I am happy at the progress and all that I have learned in the process.

ToDo's:
1: Landing Page layout and design. Fun imagery or animation effect. 
2: Crud actions are still giving me grieve. Create and Destroy are throwing browser errors but after a refresh show that they executed.
3: I feel that I need to use the react hook "useEffect" to re-render after deleting and possibily after creating.
4: Edit has not been worked on. 
5: Currently the FlashCards are not a flipping card, they use buttons to show hints and the answer, I hope to work out a better UX.
